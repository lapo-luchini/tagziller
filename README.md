TagZiller
=========

TagZiller is a [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/) plug-in to allow adding a random tagline (such as a witty quote or anything) after the e-mail signature.

This was once possible using [TagZilla](https://web.archive.org/web/20200422163705/http://tagzilla.mozdev.org/) but with deprecation of old extension system it is not usable anymore, so I decided to create this as a replacement for personal use.
